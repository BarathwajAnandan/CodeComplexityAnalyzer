    *   Select "Options" or "Open Settings".
    *   Paste your Sambanova API key into the provided field.
    *   Click "Save" or "Apply" to save your settings.
    * Feel free to experiment with other models but the default one is optimal.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate to LeetCode or NeetCode:** Go to a LeetCode or NeetCode problem page with a code editor.
2.  **Write Your Code:** Write your code solution in the online code editor.
3.  **Analyze Your Code:** Click the "Analyze Code" yellow button located near the "Submit" button.
4.  **View the Results:** The extension will display the time and space complexity analysis results directly on the page, along with a brief explanation.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Extension Not Working:**
    *   Make sure you have correctly installed the extension and enabled it in Chrome.
    *   Verify that you have entered a valid Sambanova API key in the extension settings.
    *   Ensure that you are on a LeetCode or NeetCode problem page with a code editor.
    *   Check the Chrome Developer Console (right-click on the page, select "Inspect", and go to the "Console" tab) for any error messages.
*   **Incorrect Complexity Analysis:**
    *   The complexity analysis is performed by the Sambanova API, so occasional inaccuracies may occur.
    *   Ensure that your code is valid and complete before analyzing.
    *   If you encounter persistent issues, please report them so I can fix it for you!

## Permissions

The LeetCode Complexity Analyzer extension requires the following permissions:

*   **`activeTab`:** Grants temporary access to the currently active tab when the user clicks the "Analyze Code" button.
*   **`storage`:** Allows the extension to store the user's Sambanova API key locally.
*   **`scripting`:** Enables the extension to inject content scripts and interact with LeetCode and NeetCode web pages.
*   **`https://leetcode.com/*` and `https://neetcode.io/*`:** Host permissions for accessing LeetCode and NeetCode problem pages.
